compiler at compile time sets up a Vtable for every class having virtual functions as well as the classes derived from the classes
having virtual functions

VTABLE contains the the entries that are functions pointers to the virtual functions that can be called by the objects of the classes.

next entity is Vptr that that is a hidden pointer that compiler adds to the base class this vptr pointes to the vector table of that class
 All the classes derived from this base class inherit the _vptr.
